xkb keyboard layout for developers that require German umlauts.

## Core aspects
* Uses the US keyboard layout as a base
* Supports German Umlauts and Czech letters (and probably some other languages
  too)
* Uses Capslock as Ctrl-Alt
* Embraces Linux Console Command shortcuts. Examples:
  * Capslock + j simulates Return
  * Capslock + h deletes a character

## Reasoning
Since the German keyboard layout is very impractical for programming, and I
don't believe in switching back and forth bwetween layouts, I simply took the
US layout and added Umlauts and a few other things to it.

This allows me to use all those precious braces and brackets in a reasonable
manner as well as typing all German umlauts and even the uppercase áºž, which is
a (newish) part of the German language that the regular German keyboard layout
doesn't have.


## Drawbacks
* You lose the expected functionality of your Capslock key and can't easily
  scream at people in chat anymore
* Takes a while to get used to
* You will have a hard time using normal keyboard layouts afterwards

## Key setup
Please refer to the comments in [rukb](rukb). They should tell you everything
you need to know.

### Installing
Download [rukb](rukb) to your xkb/symbols folder, e.g.:
```
sudo wget -P /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-unruh/keyboard/main/rukb

```
Make sure it is downloaded under the correct file name - especially if you're
updating the layout.

Enable it:
```
setxkbmap rukb
```

To make the change permanent, add `setxkbmap rbkb` to a script that launches
with your X-session.
